Dotfiles
========

My personal config files for applications such as vim and zsh

Setup on a new environment
--------------------------
1. `git clone https://github.com/aishsingh/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`
2. execute setup file `~/dotfiles/symlink.sh`

NOTE: You will automatically be asked for the root password when symlinking /etc files
